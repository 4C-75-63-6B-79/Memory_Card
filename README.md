# Memory Card

## [Live Demo of Memory Card Game](https://4c-75-63-6b-79.github.io/Memory_Card/)

## Description
This is my solution to the [Memory Card](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/memory-card) assignment of the **The Odin Project**. This is our second assignment with **React**. In this assigment we were supposed to use the functional components and were supposed to get familiar with **hooks**. To do this assignment I used [Rick and Morty api](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#javascript-client).

## How to play ? 
The game is the memory card game in which we are supposed to click on card and make sure that the card we are clicking on right now has not been clicked in the past. I f we click on a card that we have already clicked on we will lose the game. But we if we manage to click all the cards only once then we advance to next level.

## Installing and running
```
git clone
cd Memory_card
npm install
npm run start
```
